# S3 Backup System Documentation
## Complete Documentation Index

**Version:** 2.0.1 (with versions_ prefix strategy)  
**Last Updated:** November 7, 2025  

This has been tested by multiple users and in a production context however, not every scenario has been possible to test. Please work with this and notify of feature requests, bugs etc so we can improve. 

## 👀 Overview

Thanks for taking an interest in Backup Any Linux!

This set of scripts provides a user-driven backup solution for any Linux system, designed to backup data to S3-compatible storage. The system is ideal for automated nightly backups and prioritizes data safety with atomic operations and version history protection.

### Core Concept: User-Driven Backups

**Users choose what to backup** - no admin interaction required. Users simply place trigger files in their directories to opt-in to backups:

- **`backupthisdir.txt`** - Backs up only files in this specific directory (no subdirectories)
- **`backupalldirs.txt`** - Backs up all files and folders from this directory onward (recursive)

### How It Works

When a backup runs, the system:

1. **Discovers** - Scans mount points for trigger files (`backupthisdir.txt` or `backupalldirs.txt`)
2. **Analyzes** - Identifies new, modified, and deleted files using metadata and checksums
3. **Backs Up** - Uploads only new or changed files to S3 (incremental backups)
4. **Manages Versions** - Preserves deleted/modified files in a separate version history folder
5. **Cleanup** - Automatically removes old deleted files after a configurable retention period

### Key Features

- **Incremental backups** - Only transfers files that have changed
- **User-controlled** - Each user decides what to backup
- **No data loss design** - Nothing is permanently deleted immediately; all deleted and modified files are preserved in version history for recovery
- **Atomic operations** - State changes are performed atomically to ensure reliability and prevent corruption
- **Version history** - Deleted and modified files are retained for recovery
- **Configurable retention** - Control how long deleted files are kept
- **Production-tested** - Used successfully in real-world deployments
- **Flexible scheduling** - Run manually or via automated cron jobs

For detailed setup instructions, usage examples, and advanced features, see the documentation sections below.

**Upcoming features:**
- Exclude certain file types from backup e.g. .pem
- Additional state files to be backed up in S3 and associated checks
